# Write a program that randomly selects a number between
# 1 and 100
# Each round the user should guess what the number is,
# and the program will respond with:
# "Too large" or "Tool small"
#
# When the user guesses correctly the program ends
#
# Bonus 1: If the user typed something that is not a number,
#          show a nice alert message and read another value
#
# Bonus 2: Have the program "lie" from time to time
#          (but not too often)
